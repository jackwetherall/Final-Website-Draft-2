            <p>This is week 2-3 of our coding. In week 2, we focused on learning how to style text in css with headers,
                changing font families, and changing colour of text. We also learnt how to import and size images. We then 
                learnt an introduction to flexbox, how to link html sheets together and how to add a second style sheet to 
                learn how to create a multi page website. Clicking Either of these pictures will take you to github to view
                these tasks in full.

        <p>This is week 5-6 of our coding. In week 5 we learnt how to create a navigation bar using anchor links,
            how to use flexbox in menus, how to center an image on the page and how to imbed audio. In week 6 we then learnt 
            how to turn our navigation bar into buttons, and how to style these buttons, and finally adding a footer.

    <h1>Reflection paragraph</h1>
    <p>Reflection paragraph 
        Making this website was a fun process. However it didn’t end up how I thought it would, at first I had different design ideas. I wanted to make my navigation bar as 5 circles, but I wasn’t happy with how this looked with text inside it, so I got rid of this idea and made new wireframes and decided I wanted to make a minimalistic style of website, with a navigation bar in the top right that included some type of hover animation when the mouse went over each section, A title centred at the top of the page followed by a grid style layout of the required tasks. I then styled the text under each image making it clear which text related to each image. I was previously planning on making my website a scrolling site, however I preferred the feel of a multi page website as I felt this would seem more advanced to my friends and family when viewing the website. What went well during this process was keeping a consistent theme throughout the website. To do this I used pictures that I have taken from my time here in Bristol so far that I thought all had a similar theme and style to them. I also enjoyed creating interactive animations when you hover your mouse over different sections of the website, as I felt this made the website less static and more interesting. What also went well was implementing flexbox features that we learnt in week 5/6 of our coding worksheets. This was helpful and made styling the website easier. This task has been extremely educational as from scratch I have been able to learn how to code a website using HTML and CSS which is a skill I can take with me and develop further in my own time. I have discovered I have an interest in web design as I have not previously done any web design work before and it is something I would like to dive deeper into. One thing that I struggled with was trying to make the page accessible for smaller screens and laptops as my friends / family viewing the website would probably not have a screen as large as the Mac’s we use in class. Next time what I would do differently is create a site that is multi page but also scrolls on each page to add more depth to the site. This would lead to more customisation and be less limiting as for this site I was trying to fit everything into a certain space for each page. Next time I would also explore how to make better use of the space I have, or vary the layouts of my pages to make them appear more advanced and eye catching. Overall, creating this website was a lot of fun and I learnt a lot from it, and I will definitely explore web design more in the future.

    <h1>Scope & Strategy plane</h1>
    <p>My plan behind my html website was to create a modern, stylish, and minimalistic website 
        that is easy to navigate for everyone and my main target audience would be people in an 
        age range of myself. Despite this, it is easy to navigate and suitable for all age ranges 
        as my parents and aunts and uncles will want to see my projects from this first semester at 
        university. On top of this Mary and Mic will be marking my work so I would like to make it suitable 
        for them. My functional goals for this website are to create a user friendly and appealing navigation 
        bar with animations for this and for the pictures of my work. In my website I will not only be including 
        design work from graphic and web design, but I intend to include photos of my time here at Bristol so far
         as backgrounds of my website that captures a new and exciting life that I have began here. I have chosen 
         the photos carefully to create a specific feel and energy that I feel captures an insight into the
          student life here in Bristol outside of our studies in such a unique, creative and expressive city. 
          The actual functions my website needs to carry out is have a working navigation system that links to
           the other pages of my website. It needs to also hyperlink screenshots of my coding worksheets to
            my GitHub On top of this, my website also needs to be suitable for smaller screen sizes such as 
            small laptops as family and friends who would be viewing my page could potentially be using small 
            laptops.
