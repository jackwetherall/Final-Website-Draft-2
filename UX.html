                    <p class="caption">Here is my flowchart/wireframe, showing the
                        structure of my website and demonstrating how it can be easily
                        navigated. At the top of my multi-page website, I have a navigation bar
                        that allows my users to easily switch between tabs of the website.
                        On each page I have a title, clearly showing what work the page is demonstrating so users
                        always understand where they are in the website. Then on each page I have my work that is centered,
                        and text underneath each peice of work clearly explaining what the work is and the process behind designing it.

                <h1>Scope & Strategy plane</h1>
                <p>My plan behind my html website was to create a modern, stylish, and minimalistic website 
                    that is easy to navigate for everyone, my main target audience being people in an 
                    age range similar to myself. Despite this, it is easy to navigate and suitable for all age ranges 
                    as my parents and aunts and uncles will want to see my projects from this first semester at 
                    university. On top of this Mary and Mic will be marking my work so I would like to make it suitable 
                    for them. My functional goals for this website are to create a user friendly and appealing navigation 
                    bar with animations for this and for the pictures of my work. In my website I will not only be including 
                    design work from graphic and web design, but I intend to include photos of my time here at Bristol so far
                     as backgrounds of my website that captures a new and exciting life that I have began here. I have chosen 
                     the photos carefully to create a specific feel and energy that I feel captures an insight into the
                      student life here in Bristol outside of our studies in such a unique, creative and expressive city. 
                      The actual functions my website needs to carry out is have a working navigation system that links to
                       the other pages of my website. It needs to also hyperlink screenshots of my coding worksheets to
                        my GitHub On top of this, my website also needs to be suitable for smaller screen sizes such as 
                        small laptops as family and friends who would be viewing my page could potentially be using small 
                        laptops.
